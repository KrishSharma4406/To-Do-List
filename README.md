I recently built a To-Do List Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to share it with you!

🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for clean and responsive design

JavaScript for interactivity (add/remove tasks, local storage persistence)

✨ Key Features:

Add and delete tasks easily

Mark tasks as completed

Data is stored in your browser using localStorage, so your list stays even after a refresh!

Smooth and modern UI with responsive design

💡 This was a great learning experience and helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence on the frontend.# To-Do-List
